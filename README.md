# PALE BLUE DOT CHALLENGE -NASA

## Impact on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
This project directly addresses the **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Climate Action**. Our visualization illustrates the correlation between rising CO2 levels and changes in temperature and precipitation across **77 countries**. The insights provided can inform policy decisions and encourage actions to mitigate climate change.

## Approach
We used **Python** for data processing and visualization, leveraging the following libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations

### Dataset
The dataset contains country and year-wise data for:
- **CO2 emissions**
- **Temperature**
- **Precipitation**

The data spans from **1981 to 2022** and covers **77 countries**. It has been cleaned and structured for visualization.

## Insights from Data Visualization
A line graph titled **"Combined Data for Countries"** illustrates:
- **Precipitation (Green Line)**: Shows variations in rainfall patterns over the years. Positive values indicate increased precipitation, while negative values indicate a decrease.
- **Temperature (Blue Line)**: Displays a general increase in temperatures, suggesting global warming. Positive values signify rising temperatures, while negative values indicate a drop.
- **Annual CO2 Emissions (Red Line)**: Represents annual CO2 emissions. Fluctuations suggest changes in industrial activities or environmental policies.

This visualization is part of a larger project that includes similar graphs for all **77 countries**, offering a global perspective on CO2 emissions' impact on climate change.

### Additional Features
- Data can be further visualized on a **3D globe** to showcase temperature and precipitation trends globally.
- The visualization highlights that **CO2 alone isn't solely responsible for changes in precipitation**.
- A dedicated **interactive visualization** allows users to explore the data dynamically.

## Motivation
Climate change is a critical global issue. Our goal is to **raise awareness** about CO2 emissions' impact on global warming and encourage action through effective data visualization.

## Learnings
- Conducted research on **climate change trends and influencing factors**.
- Explored **historical climate data** and articles to strengthen our understanding.
- Designed visualizations that clearly convey the **long-term impact of CO2 emissions**.

## Ethical Considerations
- Used **reliable data sources**.
- Presented information **transparently and honestly**.
- Ensured accessibility for a **broad audience** to promote inclusivity.

## Interactive Visualization
We created an interactive visualization to enhance user engagement:
